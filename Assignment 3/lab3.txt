I first verified the problem by using the commands: 

cd /usr/bin   

ls -a -A

The probblem still exists since . and .. are still being printed.

I then check the Coreutils version with the command:

ls --version

The coreutils versison is 8.22 that corresponds to /usr/bin/ls.

We then follow the steps to build the copy:

1.
Getting the copies:
curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
curl -O https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

Verifying signature:
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Some problems that occured include the following:

This key is not certified with a trusted signautres!
There is no indiciation that the signature belongs to the owner.

This problem may occur because the keyring cannot be verifed by the program.
Therefore, anyone could create that keyring and two fake files to fool the 
system into believing it was secure. The user could then be compromised with a 
security issue.

2.
Decompress the file:
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

Compile and install the file:
cd coreutils-8.29
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/frankx/Desktop/Lab3/coreutils
make
make install

There were no problems in this step of the process.

3.
Reproducing the bug:
cd ~/Desktop/Lab3/coreutils
bin/ls -a -A 

The bug is still present as . and ... are still being printed out.

4.
Creating the patch file:
cd ~/Desktop/Lab3/coreutils-8.29
emacs patch_file

I then copied the contents into the file.

Then I patch the file:
patch -p1 < patch_file

5.
We run the commands:
cd ~/Desktop/Lab3/coreutils-8.29

This command would be needed to ensure we're in the right directory for the
following commands.

autoreconf -fi

This command would be needed to as when decompressing the file in a random
directory, one may be missing a few auxiliary files needed to run make. This
command would ensure that all the missing file would be configured before
running the make command.

make  

This command would be needed to build the correct fixed version without 
installing it into the temporary directory so I can do comparisons between the
fixed and non-fixed version.

6.
The new command worked as intended.
The new command is tested using the command:
cd ~/Desktop/Lab3/coreutils-8.29/src
./ls -a -A

The old command still prints out . and ..:
ls -a -A
