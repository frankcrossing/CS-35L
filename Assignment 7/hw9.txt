Assignment 7

1. 
I make a file for the homework:

emacs hw9.txt

2.
I check out the version 3.0 of diffutils into a new "quote" branch:

cd diffutils

git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3.
I install the change by running the patch command:

patch -p1 < ~/Desktop/Lab7/quote-3.0-patch.txt

4.
The emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window adds a new entry to the
change log file for the file currently being edited. It is invoked with the
keystrokes C-x 4 a.

5.
I compose an appropriate changeLog entry for the patch using the commands:

emacs ~/Desktop/Lab7/quote-3.0-patch.txt

C-x 4 a

I then compose the message detailing the change from ` to '.

C-x C-c

6.
I commit to the new branch using the commands:

mv ~/Desktop/lab7/ChangeLog .

git add .

git commit -F ChangeLog

7.
I generate a new file formatted-patch.txt:

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8.
I builded my partner's project through git:

cd diffutils

git am < ~/Desktop/Lab7/edward-formatted-patch.txt

./bootstrap

./configure

make

make check

I observe that all 88 tests passed with no error messages, indicating the patch
works as intended.

9.
I make sure my ChangeLog entry works by the following commands:

make distdir 

I then inspect the correct CahngeLog file:

emacs diffutils-3.0.1-1479-dirty/ChangeLog

The ChangeLog details the ChangeLog I created, indicating that my ChangeLog
entry does indeed work.

10.
I run the command gitk and find the newest merge using the commands:

ssh -X frankx@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu

cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs

gitk

Now I examine the Xming window and the find the newest merge point. The 
newest merge not newer than 2015-01-25 would be the branch 'master' into
xwidget by Joakim Verona. For the subwindows, I see one title-like 
description of the changes that the author made. I see one window with
the author's contact and name. I see one window with the time of change.
I also see a window with a ChangeLog entry as well as a window that
displays any additional comments.
