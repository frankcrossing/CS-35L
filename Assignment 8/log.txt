Assignment 8

The set up instructions can be found below:

1. I connected my Beaglebone to my computer with the USB cable.

2. I find the Beaglebone as a storage device it and open it. After it opened,
I clicked on the START.htm icon and got to the webpage.

3. After I'm on the webpage, I checked the requirements and installed the 
corresponding needed drivers and restarted my computer. This ensured that all
the requirements are fulfilled.

4. I then input the 192.168.7.2 as the ip address in putty, using the username
root to access. Since my copy of the raspberry pi is old, I used the old
password to access it.

5. After being in the pi, I connect to UCLA_WEB using the following commands:

connmanctl

enable wifi

scan wifi 

services

agent on

connect wifi_2cf7f1066697_55434c415f574542_managed_none

quit

6. I get my ip address using the command: ifconfig
The ip address is 172.28.233.151.

7. I update the database using the commands:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install xauth

sudo apt-get install xvfb

sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

The server side can be done with the following commands:

1. Generate public and private keys: ssh-keygen
The key generated is roots.

2. Create an account for client on server using the commands:

sudo useradd -d /home/edward-client -m edward

sudo passwd edward

The password set is 123.

3. Create .ssh directory for the new user using the commands:

cd /home/edward-client

sudo mkdir .ssh

4. Change ownership and permssion on .ssh directory using the commands:

sudo chown -R edward .ssh

sudo chmod 700 .ssh

The client side can be done using the commands:

1. Generate public and private keys: ssh-keygen
The key generated is roots.

2. Copy public key to the server for key-based authentication:

ssh-copy-id -i frankx@172.28.232.166 

3. Add private key to authentication agent using the commands:

eval `ssh-agent`

ssh-add

4. SSH to server using the commands:

ssh -X frankx@172.28.232.166

5. I then run the commands for testing:

firefox

This command will being up the firefox browser successfully on my labtop. The
command would also work if I used the trusted forwarding (-Y) with the firefox 
window opening up in that situation also.
